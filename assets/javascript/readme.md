#Star Wars Word Guess Game

https://danielpruitt.github.io/WordGuessGame/

This game was built as an introduction to Javascript. It was completed with "vanilla" Javascript. 
The gameplay is simple. Upon clicking the start button the player sees the underscores for a name of a character in the Star Wars universe. The player recieves 10 incorrect guesses before they lose that round. They also cannot use the same letter or number twice so it does not count towards using a life. If the lives are spent without guessing the correct character, an alert triggers letting the user know they lost after which they can restart the game. If they guess the character correctly, the image of the character and a song based off the Dark or Light Side will play.
